### Introduction
  
Chinese Chess (or Xiangqi) is a strategy board game for two players. The game represents a battle between two armies, with the objective of capturing the enemy's general.

In this program, we can play 1 vs 1 or against AI. The AI is based on minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning at a very simple level which can easily be extended. This is just an illustration of implementing minimax method for AI decision making in board game.
